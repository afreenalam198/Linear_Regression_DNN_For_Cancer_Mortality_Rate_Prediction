# Cancer Mortality Rate Prediction Using Linear Regeression and Deep Neural Networks

## Dataset Description - 

The data was aggregated from a number of sources including the American Community
Survey (https://www.census.gov), https://www.clinicaltrials.gov, and https://www.cancer.gov.

The number of data samples included in the dataset is 3047. 
Each data sample has 33 features.  
The label of this dataset is TARGET_deathRate.  

## Problem Statement -

This dataset is being used to predict cancer mortality rate from various
features such as average deaths per year, age, ethnicity, education level, income level,
marital status, birth rate etc.
