For Data Preprocessing -


Since I have used Google Colab for this assignment, my instructions are based on how to run my codes on Google Colab.  
Open Google Colab and upload the Data_Preprocessing.ipynb file.  
Upload the cancer_reg.csv file (uploaded files will be removed if your runtime gets disconnected).  
Run the codes.  
3 csv files will be generated.   
You can download the Train, Validation and Test csv files.
