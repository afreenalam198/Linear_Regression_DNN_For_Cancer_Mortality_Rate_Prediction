For Running all the models

Since I have used Google Colab for this assignment, my instructions are based on how to run my codes on Google Colab.
Open Google Colab and upload the model.ipynb file (For Example - DNN_16.ipynb)
Upload the train_cancer_reg.csv,  validation_cancer_reg.csv and test_cancer_reg.csv files (uploaded files will be removed if your runtime gets disconnected).
Run the codes.
